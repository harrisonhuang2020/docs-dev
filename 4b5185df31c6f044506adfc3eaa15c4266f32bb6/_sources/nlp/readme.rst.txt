The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how the SeaChat meeting RESTFul APIs can be used to retrieve meeting analytics. In this tutorial we will walk-through:
    - How to use the Summarization API to generate short and long summaries from a meeting transcript
    - How to use the Topic Prediction API to predict topics from meeting transcript
    - How to use the Action Extraction API to extract and summarize actionable items from a meeting transcript

The end result will be a robust set of meeting analytics.

The code for these systems can be found in the Seasalt.ai SeaWord repository.

Summarization API
=================

The Summarization API uses mBART-50 based summarization models to generate summaries of single turn utterances and full transcripts in multiple languages.
The tutorial will walk through the different API calls to access these models.

Topic Prediction API
====================

The Topic Prediction API uses a combination of abstractive and extractive techniques to return a list of relevant topics and keywords from a document.

:ref:`Topic Prediction Tutorial ---> <topic_tutorial>`

Action Extraction API
=====================

The Action Extraction API extracts and summarizes action items from a document. 

:ref:`Action Extraction Tutorial ---> <action_tutorial>`

Cross Lingual NER API
=====================

The Cross Lingual NER API uses one model to extract 30+ common entities from over 100 languages.

Machine Reading API
===================

The Machine Reading API performs extracting machine reading to answer questions given a context text. The tutorial will walk through the API calls to access this model.
